**🚧 STATUS: UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT 🚧**

This is the monorepo for my personal portfolio website. Unlike standard static portfolios, this is a full-stack application engineered to demonstrate my expertise in **scalable backend systems** and **AI integration**.

The core feature is a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent that allows visitors to chat with my resume and ask questions about my experience in real-time.

## 🚀 The Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot
- **AI & Data:** LLM Integration, Vector Embeddings

## 🛠 Features (In Progress)

- **Interactive AI Assistant:** A "Chat with my Resume" feature that answers recruiter queries contextually.
- **Project Deep Dives:** Technical breakdowns of my work in Data Engineering and Math.
- **Upskilling Blog:** A log of my current learning path.
